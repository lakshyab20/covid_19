Visualizing the Covid-19 pandemic using Choropleth Maps

Choropleth Maps
A choropleth map is a type of thematic map where areas or regions are shaded in proportion to a given data variable.
Static choropleth maps are most useful when you want to compare a desired variable by region. For example, if you wanted to compare the crime rate of each state in the US at a given moment, you could visualize it with a static choropleth.

An animated or dynamic choropleth map is similar to a static choropleth map, except that you can compare a variable by region, over time. This adds a third dimension of information and is what makes these visualizations so interesting and powerful.
